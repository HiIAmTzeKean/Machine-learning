# Curse of dimensionality

The addition of [[Predictor]] that are associated with the [[Response]] would generally improve the model fit. However, addition of non-associated predictors increases the noise and the [[Dimension]] of the problem, leading to the risk of [[Overfitting]].

## Relation to [[Prediction accuracy]]
There are also times when a predictor might be relevant, but the [[Variance]] increase might outweigh the decrease in bias. Refer to [[Bias and variance trade-off]].
