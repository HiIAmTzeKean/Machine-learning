# Decision tree split threshold

To split a [[Recursive binary splitting]], a high threshold of a decrease in [[Residual sum of squares|RSS]] should be met before a split is made.
## Advantage
This results in smaller [[Tree]]s
## Disadvantage
The decision made is too short-sighted. A poor split leading to a good split could be missed. Refer to the limitations of [[Greedy algorithm]].
