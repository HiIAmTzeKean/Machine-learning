# Non-parametric learning

Unlike [[Parametric learning]], there are no explicit assumptions made about the functional form f. These type of learning produces [[Flexible model]]s for prediction.

## Limitation
- Not reducing the problem of estimation to small number of [[Parameter]]
    - Requires a large number of observation to fit the model
- [[Overfitting]] when [[Predictor]]s used are high but not necessary related to the [[Response]]
- [[Interpretation]] of the model can be more challenging
