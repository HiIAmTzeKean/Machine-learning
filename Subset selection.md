# Subset selection

- [[Best subset selection]]
- [[Stepwise model selection]]
## Questions
- When performing [[Best subset selection]], [[Forward stepwise selection]], [[Backward stepwise selection]], which of the 3 models will have the smallest [[Training error rate]] and consequently smallest training [[Residual sum of squares]]
- Following up from previous question, which will have smallest [[Test error rate]]
- The [[Predictor]] in a k-variable model identified by [[Forward stepwise selection]] is a subset of the predictors in its (K+1) step
- The predictor for a k-variable model identified by [[Backward stepwise selection]] is a subset of the predictors in its (K+1) step
- The predictor in the k-variable model identified by [[Forward stepwise selection]] is a subset of the predictor in the K+1 variable model identified by [[Backward stepwise selection]]
    - In essence, the question is asking if there is a connection between the forward stepwise and backward stepwise method
