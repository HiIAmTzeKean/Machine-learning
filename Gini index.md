# Gini index

Measures the inequality in a node or also known as impurity. The higher the gini coefficient the more pure it is.
$$G = \sum_{k=1}^K \hat p_{mk} (1-\hat p_{mk})$$
In this case, we can see that the value of G is bounded by $[0,0.5]$. Related to [[Tree]] and [[Decision tree]]

Here m represents the region and k represents those belonging to the kth class.
