# Odds

$$odds=\frac{P(X)}{1-P(X)} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1X} \in [0,\infty]$$Traditionally used in horse-racing since it is more natural.

Note that when P(X) increases, the denominator decreases. For an increase in numerator and decrease in denominator, the odds would increase by a greater extent.
The reverse is also true. When P(X) decreases, the odds will decrease by a greater extent.
