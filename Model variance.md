# Model variance
The sample $X_{1},X_{2}\dots$ is random and thus the model constructed could be vary. The model variance is then formally defined as
$$Var(\hat Y (x))$$
From the [[Bias and variance trade-off]] we can see how [[Overfitting]] might cause the variance to increase, because a small difference in the [[Random sample]] could lead to a huge difference in the model.
