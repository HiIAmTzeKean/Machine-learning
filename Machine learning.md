# Machine learning

The dataset is typically split into [[Train data|Train set]], [[Validation set]] and [[Test set]].
The train set is used to fit the models and [[validation set]] is to estimate the prediction error for model selection. The [[Test set]] is isolated from the entire training process and used to assess how well the model generalise to unseen data.
