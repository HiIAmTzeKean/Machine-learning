# Model interpretability
Usually most [[Predictor]]s used in [[Multiple linear regression]] are not associated with the [[Response]]. Use of irrelevant variables leads to more complexities making it tough interpret the model.
Removal of these variables can be done through setting the coefficients of these variables to zero. This process is known as [[Variable selection]]
## Relation to [[Linear regression]]
[[Least squares]] unlikely to yield any [[Coefficient]] that are exactly zero. Making it difficult to decide if the variable is irrelevant.
