# Linear assumption regression

## Assumption
The change in [[Response]] Y is for a unit-change in [[Predictor]] X is constant regardless the value of X.
## Extension of the linear model
Non-linear relationships can be modelled using [[Polynomial regression]]. For example
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_1^2$$
such that the function is not linear but the model is still linear.
