# Test error rate

The average [[Error rate]] that results from using a [[Statistical learning]] method to predict the response on a new observation.
## Significance to [[Training error rate]]
- The decrease of training error rate does not always imply that the test error rate will decrease
    - The graph of the test error rate tends to be a [[U shaped graph]] when plotted with training error rate
