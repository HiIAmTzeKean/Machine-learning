# Training error rate and models with more variables
## [[R square]] and [[Residual sum of squares|RSS]]
As the number of variables included in the model increases, the [[Training error rate]] will decrease. As the number of [[Predictor]]/[[Variable]] included increases, the model fit improves. Nuances in the patterns of the [[Train data]] are captured.
This does not imply that the [[Test error rate]] will decrease as such patterns may not actually exist in the test data.
## Indirectly estimating test error
Though use of [[Information criteria]] to adjust the training error for the model.
## Directly estimating test error
Through means like [[Validation set approach]] or [[Cross validation]].
