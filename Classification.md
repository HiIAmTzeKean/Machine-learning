# Classification
## Accuracy
Quantifying the accuracy of estimate $\hat{f}$ through [[Error rate]].
## Training error rate
Using the equation from [[Training error rate]] to compute the proportion of incorrect classification.
## Test error rate
Computation of the [[Test error rate]] based on the average incorrect classification.
$$Ave(I(y_0 \not= \hat{y}_0)$$
## Types of classifiers
- [[Bayes classifier]]
- [[K nearest neighbours]]
- [[Logistic regression]]
- [[Linear discriminant analysis]]
