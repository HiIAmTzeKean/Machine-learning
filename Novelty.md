# Novelty
Novelty is computed as the minus logarithm of (number of interactions with item / total number of interactions).

The novelty of an item can be defined relative to a set of observed events on the set of all items. These can be events of user choice (item “is picked” by a random user) or user discovery (item “is known” to a random user). The above definition of novelty reflects a factor of item popularity. High novelty values correspond to long-tail items in the density function, that few users have interacted with and low novelty values correspond to popular head items.
