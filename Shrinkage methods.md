# Shrinkage methods
Control [[Variance]] of [[Prediction]] through shrinking [[Coefficient]] estimates towards zero.
## Question
- [[The lasso]] against [[Least squares]]
    - Which is a more [[Flexible model]]
        - Does [[Flexible model]] give improved [[Prediction accuracy]]
- [[Ridge regression]] tends to give similar [[Coefficient]] values to [[Correlation|Correlated]] variables while [[The lasso]] may give different [[Coefficient]] values
- Derive [[Bayesian]] connection to [[The lasso]] and [[Ridge regression]]
