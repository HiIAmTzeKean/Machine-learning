# Estimating test error

The choice of the best model in [[Best subset selection]] and [[Stepwise model selection]] through use of [[Residual sum of squares|RSS]] or [[R square]] [[Statistic]] only gives a good estimate of the [[Training error rate]] and not the [[Test error rate]].
## Approach to estimate test error rate
1. Indirectly estimate test error through adjustment to training error to account for [[Bias]] from [[Overfitting]]
    1. [[Information criteria]]
2. Directly estimate test error through [[Validation set approach]] or [[Cross validation]]
