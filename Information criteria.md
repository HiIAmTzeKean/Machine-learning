# Information criteria
## Idea
Adjusting the [[Training error rate]] for the model size.
- [[Cp]]
- [[AIC]]
- [[BIC]]
- [[Adjusted R square]]
## Limitation
Not appropriate in [[High dimension data]] since it is difficult to estimate $\hat \sigma^2$. In high dimensional setting, [[Adjusted R square]] also gives a value of 1.
