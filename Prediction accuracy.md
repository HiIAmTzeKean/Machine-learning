# Prediction accuracy
The true relationship between the [[Response]] and [[Predictor]] is approximately [[Linear]] such that the [[Least squares]] estimate will be a low bias. 
## Cases
- if $n \gg p$, where n is number of observations and p is the number of variables, then the estimate will tend to have low [[Variance]]. 
- if $n>p$ by a small margin, then there can be a lot of [[Variability]] in the least squares fit. [[Overfitting]] can occur.
- if $p>n$ then variance is infinite, it doesn't make sense to use [[Least squares]] method
    - There be no [[Unique]] solution that can be found
## Question
- What is the link between accuracy with [[Bias]] and [[Variance]]
